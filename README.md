# Formalizing 100 theorems in Agda

[Freek Wiedijk's webpage](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/) lists [100 famous
theorems](http://pirate.shu.edu/~kahlnath/Top100.html) and how many of those
have been formalised using proof assistants. This repository keeps track of the
statements that have been proved using the [Agda programming
language](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php).

If you have a formalization of one of those theorems or are aware of one, please
[tell me](https://github.com/smimram/agda100/issues).
